# Microsoft Azure Container Networking

## Azure VNET CNI Plugins
`azure-vnet` CNI plugin implements the [CNI network plugin interface](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md).

`azure-vnet-ipam` CNI plugin implements the [CNI IPAM plugin interface](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md#ip-address-management-ipam-interface).

The plugins are designed to work together. The IPAM plugin can also be used by 3rd party software to manage IP addresses from Azure VNET space.

## Install
Copy the plugin package from the release share to your Azure VM and extract the contents to the CNI directories.

You can also install by running the `install-cni-plugin.sh` script provided in the `build` directory of this repository. Update the parameters at the top of the script with your preferences.

```bash
$ build/install-cni-plugin.sh
```

## Build
Plugins can also be built directly from the source code in this repository.

```bash
make azure-vnet
make azure-vnet-ipam
make azure-cni-plugins
```

The first two commands build an individual plugin, whereas the third one builds both and generates a tar archive. The binaries are placed in the `output` directory.

## Network Configuration
Network configuration for CNI plugins is described in JSON format. The default location for configuration files is `/etc/cni/net.d` for Linux and `c:\cni` for Windows.

```json
{
  "cniVersion": "0.2.0",
  "name": "azure",
  "type": "azure-vnet",
  "master": "eth0",
  "bridge": "azure0",
  "ipam": {
    "type": "azure-vnet-ipam",
    "environment": "azure"
  }
}
```

The following fields are well-known and have the following meaning:

Network plugin
* `cniVersion`: Azure plugins currently support versions 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 of the [CNI spec](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md). Support for new spec versions will be added shortly after each CNI release.
* `name`: Name of the network. This property can be set to any unique value.
* `type`: Name of the network plugin. This property should always be set to `azure-vnet`.
* `master`: Name of the host network interface that will be used to connect containers to a VNET. This field is optional. If omitted, the plugin will automatically pick a suitable host network interface. Typically, the primary host interface name is `"Ethernet"` on Windows and `"eth0"` on Linux.
* `bridge`: Name of the bridge. This field is optional.

IPAM plugin
* `type`: Name of the IPAM plugin. This property should always be set to `azure-vnet-ipam`.
* `environment`: Name of the environment. Valid values are `azure` for [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and `mas` for [Microsoft Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/). This field is optional. The default value is `azure`.

You can create multiple network configuration files to connect containers to multiple networks.

Network configuration files are processed in lexical order during container creation, and in the reverse-lexical order during container deletion.

## Logs
Logs generated by `azure-vnet` plugin are available in `/var/log/azure-vnet.log` on Linux and `c:\cni\azure-vnet.log` on Windows.

Logs generated by `azure-vnet-ipam` plugin are availble in `/var/log/azure-vnet.log` on Linux and `c:\cni\azure-vnet-ipam.log` on Windows.
